## TRIANGLE TRACKER

This application determine if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or not a triangle.

##  Description

An equilateral triangle has all three sides the same length.

An isosceles triangle has at least two sides the same length. (It is sometimes specified as having exactly two sides the same length, but for the purposes of this exercise we'll say at least two.

A scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths.

Note
For a shape to be a triangle at all, all sides have to be of length > 0, and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side. See Triangle Inequality.

The case where the sum of the lengths of two sides equals that of the third is known as a degenerate triangle - it has zero area and looks like a single line and the results of the code should prompt not a triangle.

## Known Bugs
There are no known bugs at the moment but kindly feel free to contact me via github:https://github.com/bertocarl/triangle-tracker

## Technologies used
The program is written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages and in the project I have used error handling functions in JavaScript to reduce chances of errors while tracking for an accurate answer. The results are also displayed with a pictorial representation which I think is a plus for the system.
